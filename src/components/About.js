                    Driven by a constant desire to learn and grow, I recently discovered a keen interest in software development. Currently, I am immersed in a 16-week intensive software development course at CodeClan, where I am acquiring the necessary skills to transition into a rewarding career in the tech industry.

                    My life outside of work involves many a trip to the cinema; I love to immerse myself in a good film. I also spend my spare time with friends, usually travelling to new countries and places, going to concerts, festivals and eating out.
